This R Markdown document presents the proposal for the Capstone Project:

Project Name: Energy Efficiency Analysis
Data Set Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Project Abstract:

This project is an analysis of an Energy Efficiency Data Set whereby it contains heating and Loading requirements of energy-efficient buildings as a function of building parameters. 

Reasons for selecting this data set:
1) Relevant data although collected in 2012.
2) Multivariate Data characteristics.
3) Able to perform both classification or regression analysis.

Data Set information:

The Energy Efficienfy Data set uses 12 different building shapes to determine variants in heating and cooling loads. The buildings differ with respect to the glazing area, the glazing area distribution, and the orientation, amongst other parameters. We simulate various settings as functions of the afore-mentioned characteristics to obtain 768 building shapes. The dataset comprises of 768 samples and 8 features (attribites), aiming to predict two real valued responses. 

Project Statement:

The goal is to create a model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform classification, come up with a prediction model and be able to tune that model. 

SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression. However often used in classification especially where the dataset is not complexed. 

Project Deliverables:
1 - Process and methodology.
2 - Prediction Data.
3 - A tuned model and evaluation.
4 - A report containing all of the above and R code.
